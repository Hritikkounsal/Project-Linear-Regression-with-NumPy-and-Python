Linear Regression : 1.cost functions  2.gradient descent 3. linear regression from scratch
The objective of linear regression is to minimize the cost function

$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} )^2$$
where $h_{\theta}(x)$ is the hypothesis and given by the linear model

$$h_{\theta}(x) = \theta^Tx = \theta_0 + \theta_1x_1$$
